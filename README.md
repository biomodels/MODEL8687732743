# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Network topology determines dynamics of the mammalian MAPK1,2 signaling network: bifan motif regulation of C-Raf and B-Raf isoforms by FGFR and MC1R.**   
Muller M, Obeyesekere M, Mills GB, Ram PT. _FASEB J._ 2008;22(5):1393-403.
[18171696](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18171696) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) and melanocyte stimulating
hormone (MC1R) receptors stimulates B-Raf and C-Raf isoforms that regulate the
dynamics of MAPK1,2 signaling. Network topology motifs in mammalian cells
include feed-forward and feedback loops and bifans where signals from two
upstream molecules integrate to modulate the activity of two downstream
molecules. We computationally modeled and experimentally tested signal
processing in the FGFR/MC1R/B-Raf/C-Raf/MAPK1,2 network in human melanoma
cells; identifying 7 regulatory loops and a bifan motif. Signaling from FGFR
leads to sustained activation of MAPK1,2, whereas signaling from MC1R results
in transient activation of MAPK1,2. The dynamics of MAPK activation depends
critically on the expression level and connectivity to C-Raf, which is
critical for a sustained MAPK1,2 response. A partially incoherent bifan motif
with a feedback loop acts as a logic gate to integrate signals and regulate
duration of activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Further reducing a
106-node ordinary differential equations network encompassing the complete
network to a 6-node network encompassing rate-limiting processes sustains the
feedback loops and the bifan, providing sufficient information to predict
biological responses.
